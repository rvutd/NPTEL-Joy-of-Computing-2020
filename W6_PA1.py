# Programming Assignment-1: Computing Paradox
# Due on 2020-03-12, 23:59 IST
# You are provided with a playlist containing N songs, each has a unique positive integer length. 
# Assume you like all the songs from this playlist, but there is a song, which you like more than others.
# It is named "Computing Paradox".

# You decided to sort this playlist in increasing order of songs length. For example, 
# if the lengths of the songs in the playlist were {1, 3, 5, 2, 4} after sorting it becomes {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
# Before the sorting, "Computing Paradox" was on the kth position 
# (1-indexing is assumed for the playlist) in the playlist.

# Your task is to find the position of "Computing Paradox" in the sorted playlist.

# Input Format:
# The first line contains two numbers N denoting the number of songs in the playlist.
# The second line contains N space separated integers A1, A2, A3,..., AN denoting the lengths of songs.
# The third line contains an integer k, denoting the position of "Computing Paradox" in the initial playlist.

# Output Format:

# Output a single line containing the position of "Computing Paradox" in the sorted playlist.

# Example:
# Input:
# 4
# 1 3 4 2
# 2
