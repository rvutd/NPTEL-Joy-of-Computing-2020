# With a given list L of integers, write a program to print this list L after removing all duplicate
#  values with original order preserved.

# Example:
# If the input list is

# 12 24 35 24 88 120 155 88 120 155

# Then the output should be

# 12 24 35 88 120 155

# Explanation:
# Third, seventh and ninth element of the list L has been removed because it was already present.

# Input Format:
# In one line take the elements of the list L with each element separated by a space.

# Output Format:
# Print the elements of the modified list in one line with each element separated by a space.

# Example:
# Input:
# 12 24 35 24

# Output:
# 12 24 35
