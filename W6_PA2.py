# Given a positive integer number n, you have to write a program that generates a dictionary d which contains
# (i, i*i*i) such that i is the key and i*i*i is its value, where i is from 1 to n (both included).
# Then you have to just print this dictionary d.

# Example:
# Input: 4

# will give output as
# {1: 1, 2: 8, 3: 27, 4: 64}

# Input Format:
# Take the number n in a single line.

# Output Format:
# Print the dictionary d in a single line.


# Example:

# Input:
# 8

# Output:
# {1: 1, 2: 8, 3: 27, 4: 64, 5: 125, 6: 216, 7: 343, 8: 512}

# Explanation:

# Here n is 8, we will start from i=1, hence the first element of the dictionary is (1: 1), 
# as i becomes 2, the second element of the dictionary becomes (2: 8) and so on.
# Hence the output will be {1: 1, 2: 8, 3: 27, 4: 64, 5: 125, 6: 216, 7: 343, 8: 512}.
