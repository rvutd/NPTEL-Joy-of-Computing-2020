# Arun is working in an office which is N blocks away from his house.
# He wants to minimize the time it takes him to go from his house to the office.
# He can either take the office cab or he can walk to the office.
# Arun's velocity is V1 m/s when he is walking. The cab moves with velocity V2 m/s but whenever he calls for the cab,
# it always starts from the office, covers N blocks, collects Arun and goes back to the office.
# The cab crosses a total distance of N meters when going from office to Arun's house and vice versa,
# whereas Arun covers a distance of 2–√∗N while walking.
# Help Arun to find whether he should walk or take a cab to minimize the time.

# Input Format:
# A single line containing three integer numbers N, V1, and V2 separated by a space.

# Output Format:
# Print 'Walk' or 'Cab' accordingly

# Constraints:
# 1<=V1, V2 <=100

# 1<=N<=200

# Example-1:
# Input:
# 5 10 15

# Output:
# Cab

# Example-2:
# Input:
# 2 10 14

# Output:
# Walk
