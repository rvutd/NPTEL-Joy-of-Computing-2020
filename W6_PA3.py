# Given an integer number n, define a function named printDict()
# which can print a dictionary where the keys are numbers
# between 1 and n (both included) and the values are square of keys.
# The function printDict() doesn't take any argument.

# Input Format:
# The first line contains the number n.

# Output Format:
# Print the dictionary in one line.

# Example:

# Input:
# 5

# Output:
# {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}

# NOTE: You are supposed to write the code for the function printDict() only. 
# The function has already been called in the main part of the code.
